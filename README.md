## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a **Computer Engineer & AI Researcher** specializing in **deep learning, computer vision, NLP, and agentic AI**, with a focus on **AI for healthcare** and **meta-reasoning systems**. I develop **end-to-end AI systems** for medical imaging, automated report generation, and advanced reasoning frameworks.

- 🌱 I’m currently exploring **foundational models**, **agentic AI**, and **multimodal reasoning systems**.  
- 🔭 I work on projects like **NeuroFusion** (MRI brain tumor segmentation & report generation), **AI Sehat Bridge** (cloud-based healthcare AI), and **MAS-TGR** (agentic multi-agent reasoning).  
- 💡 Passionate about bridging **AI research & practical healthcare solutions**.

## 🚀 Projects

### **NeuroFusion** 🧠
Automated **brain tumor segmentation and MRI report generation** system.  
- Uses **Segformer & 3D U-Net** for segmentation.  
- Integrates **ViT + T5** for structured report generation.  
- Cloud-based platform for **real-time doctor accessibility**.  
[Repo Link](https://github.com/your-username/neurofusion)

### **AI Sehat Bridge** 🌐
Healthcare AI platform connecting clinics with **automated analysis pipelines**.  
- Supports **multimodal medical data ingestion**.  
- Implements **foundational models** for diagnostic suggestions.  
- Part of **NIC Islamabad & Founder Institute Program**.  
[Repo Link](https://github.com/your-username/ai-sehat-bridge)

### **MAS-TGR: Multi-Agent System with Templated Graph Reasoning** 🤖
Research-focused project in **agentic AI and structured reasoning**.  
- Designed a hierarchical **Multi-Agent System** with **Templated Graph-of-Thought (GoT) reasoning** and **Swarm Consensus**.  
- **Top-level Planning Agent** dynamically routes queries to specialized worker agents for structured reasoning.  
- Implemented **BacktrackManager** for inference: failed reasoning nodes trigger dynamic reallocation to re-plan and re-execute, enabling **meta-cognition and test-time compute allocation**.  
- Achieved **~65% improvement in answer fidelity** by preventing hallucinations via reasoning templates and verification loops.  
- Serves as a **practical instantiation of supervisor-agent frameworks** in real-world AI systems.

### **Medical Imaging Models** 🩻
- **Segformer**: Retinal fluid segmentation (Dice 0.83).  
- **YOLOv8**: Spine CT segmentation (mAP50 0.96).  
- **3D U-Net + Segformer**: Brain tumor segmentation (Dice up to 0.80).
